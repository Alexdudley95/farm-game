--Simple farming game using JS/Jquery, HTML & CSS--

This is a simple farming game where the goal is to plant seeds on ground that is at touching at least one tile of water. 

The system uses a 2D array for the tile map and utilizes the MVC model.

This is my first time implementing a 2D array and passing types to each one of the items within the array.
A function will then check the surrounding tiles to see if it is water- if true, the plant will not die when planted.
